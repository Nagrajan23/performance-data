# CPU STATISTICS DATA AQUISITION, STUDY AND ANALYSIS
This project basically records all the parameters of a processor and writes it in a Excel file using a MATLAB code, which you can find in the 'code' folder.
The data we collected stored in 'Logs' folder is under various circumstances like web surfing, live video streaming and idle condition.
Data was collected in such way to analyse and compare the performance parameters in a systematic manner.
The results we obtained are stored in 'graphs' folder in graphical format.



<b> Few tips: </b>
You can edit the number of readings and parameters you want by doing minor changes in the program.
Before running this code in your MATLAB, you need to save the MATLAB codes and Excel file named 'CPU_stats' with the parameters specified in log files at the path --> C:\Users\Documents\MATLAB .  



<b> Results obtained: </b> 
Method 2 (using timer) is better than method 1 (using delay function).
