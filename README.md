# CPU Statistics Data Aquisition, Study and Analysis
* This project basically records all the parameters of a processor and writes it in a Excel file using a MATLAB code, which can found in the 'code' folder.
* The data collected stored in 'Logs' folder is under various circumstances like web surfing, live video streaming and idle condition.
* Data was collected in such way to analyse and compare the performance parameters in a systematic manner.
* The results we obtained are stored in 'graphs' folder in graphical format.



<b> Few tips: </b>
1. Edit the number of readings and parameters by doing minor changes in the program. </br>
2. Before running this code in MATLAB, save the MATLAB codes and Excel file named 'CPU_stats' with the parameters specified in log files at the following path:
